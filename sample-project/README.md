# Sample Project

This directory contains example context files for the AI-augmented requirements workflow.

## Structure

```
sample-project/
└── context/
    ├── architecture.md     # Example architecture context
    ├── business.md         # Example business rules and domain knowledge
    ├── testing.md         # Example test patterns and step library
    └── tech_standards.md  # Example technical standards (Go, IoC patterns)
```

## Purpose

These files demonstrate how to structure context for AI agents. Use them as:
- **Templates** for your own project's context files
- **Examples** of what level of detail AI agents need
- **Reference** when setting up your workflow

## Usage

See `../docs/README.md` for complete workflow documentation.
